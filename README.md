Growth of chess audience (one of assignment)
rowth of chess audience and samay raina's youtube during lockdown (Coursera Assignment)

## What is it about?
During the initial covid lockdown in 2020, chess as a game on youtube blew up in India. I plotted the interest in chess during the time, using samay raina's youtube views, and google India's search trends.

## How was it done?
I used youtube API to get the views on samay's videos through the lockdown. For the google search trends, I downloaded the CSVs using google's official web-app. For cleaning the data and plotting, I used python's pandas library.

## Results
* Views of Samay's channel starting from his first video on March 23, through the date of completing this project.
